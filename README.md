This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to handling missing image sources. The `bug.html` file contains code that attempts to insert an image with a non-existent source path.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides a solution that gracefully handles the missing image, preventing errors and improving user experience.  The core problem is that the browser's response to a missing image can interfere with the page's layout and functionality if not properly addressed.  The solution employs error handling and fallback mechanisms.
